Browsing pics of Iceland I randomly found these two pictures about Kerlingafjöll:

- First one is taken ca. 1900. (Source: Icelandic and Faroese Photographs of Frederick W.W. Howell, Cornell University Library https://www.flickr.com/photos/cornelluniversitylibrary/4558907102)
- Second one is taken in 2010. (Source: South, Iceland, Ijsland 2010  Kerlingafjöll - Stef Strobbe http://www.panoramio.com/photo/42460194)
